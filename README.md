# biol437
Expression dataset for transcriptomics analysis
All R commands are in the biol437exercises.pdf file (or as an alternative, biol437exercises.Rmd can be opened in RStudio)

To run the exercises, you will need two input files
1. genelengths.txt
2. The gene expression dataset GTEX_readcounts.txt . The gene expression data matrix is too large to be uploaded on GitHub. Download it from this link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vi68pyxtooy1aeu/GTEX_readcounts.txt?dl=0
